CIFAR10 CNN Classification Model

Approach:
- Develop a custom CNN inspired by a famous architecture in this project it will be DenseNet model, then train the model from scratch.
  
- Perform transfer learning on the a famous model (DenseNet model):
  - We reuse DenseNet-121 Transfer Learning Model and uplode it on drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18n7rKP9HDllCYsIT5g9yrqSbN1OyAoxT?usp=sharing
  
- Compare between the built model and the TL model performance.
  - Transfer Learning with DenseNet121: Achieved 95.9% validation accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset
  - Custom Model (Inspired by DenseNet): Achieved lower accuracy compared to transfer learning which was 86.09%
