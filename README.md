CIFAR10 CNN Inspired be DenseNet

Approach:
- Develop a custom CNN inspired by DenseNet, train from scratch.
  
- Perform transfer learning on the DenseNet model:
  - We reuse DenseNet-121 Transfer Learning Model and uplode it on drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18n7rKP9HDllCYsIT5g9yrqSbN1OyAoxT?usp=sharing
  
- Compare between models performance.
  - Transfer Learning with DenseNet121: Achieved 95.9% validation accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset
  - Custom Model (Inspired by DenseNet): Achieved lower accuracy compared to transfer learning which was 86.09%
